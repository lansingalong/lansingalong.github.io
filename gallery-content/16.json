It is based on a Russian folk tale called The Runaway Soldier and the Devil. This poster is designed to capture the mood of the piece and advertise an orchestra concert where the piece would be played. <br><br>Process<br> Researched the story, sketched six different compositions and concepts, and discussed with client the best layout for the final poster. Created a variation for Facebook cover of the poster for event invites.",
