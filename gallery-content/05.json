	"title": "Paul Rand Exhibition",
	"description": "Paul Rand is a celebrated graphic designer and one of the forerunners that brought the importance of design into the corporate world. Some of his popular designs include Apple's NEXT computer logo, IBM, UPS, and ABC logo. His poster designs are geometric, colorful, bright, but also simplistic and whimsical. <br><br>Process<br> This museum exhibition project is designed to highlight the reels of Paul Rand's life work and give the audience a brief understanding of Rand as well as attract attention from a distance. Consideration was taken to acknowledge the elements, constraints and practicality of a 3D environmental space. Challenges also included selecting which pieces would work best for the exhibit after research, sketching, conceptualizing and developing a 3D paper model of the exhibit.",
