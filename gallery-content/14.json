	"description": "Poster Series.<br><br>These pages tell individual stories. Stories of a place, event, person, or an idea that is taken from the podcast, The Memory Palace, hosted by Nate Dimeo. They are paired with Ira Glass' The Art of Storytelling, where Glass explains the two main elements of a successful story: an anecdote and a moment of reflection. These pages are designed to be a poster series and meant to be viewed holistically. On the left side is Glass' explanation on storytelling an excerpt from the particular podcast, and on the right side are illustrative pieces of the anecdote that come together and form the entire story. Podcast stories can be found at: <a href=\"http://thememorypalace.us\" target=\"_blank\"> thememorypalace.us</a>" ,
