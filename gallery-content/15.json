	"description": "Designed two spreads for an annual travel magazine. Concept is a focus on Jiufen, a tourist attraction in the mountains of Keelang, Taiwan. Jiufen is also known as 9-Portions. During the first years of the Qing Dynasty, the isolated village housed nine families, thus the village would request \"nine portions\" every time shipments arrived from town, and the name 9-Portions became a standard among its people. This town became popular after Hayao Miyazaki used it as a model for the hit film, Spirited Away.<br><br>Process</br> Illustrations and photographs were personally made for these spreads. Used a grid system, combined photography, illustration and typography in a coherent way for the reader to engage in a visually-fun experience while also communicating hierarchies of various information such as lodging information and common tourist areas around Jiufen.",
