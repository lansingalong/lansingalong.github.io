	"description": "Collaborative project using a variety of different screen printing techniques creating an experience of a lucid dream. <br><br>Process<br> To create a vivid and visual space that would engulf the viewer in various senses from sight to hearing, creating a dream-like realm that is also naturalistic. A video is projected to the wall of a river flowing so the sound of water reminds the viewer of nature, as does the different textures screen printed and pasted onto the walls. The juxtaposition of bright, unnatural colors of the clouds and diamond patterns with the subdued bark textures give a sense of familiarity but also uneasiness.",
