My rankings of 35 ideas of making the invisible, visible, or vice versa. Each idea lists what the subject is, why is the visibility or invisibility of the subject a problem/topic of interest, and what would be the ultimate purpose/function of exploring the subject. (Audience takeaway)

1. **Taste receptors, or artificial flavors that are supposed to be natural.**
  - I think it’s interesting that tasting/eating is something that everybody does everyday yet we don’t really think twice about how we are able to taste food. It would be interesting to visualize taste receptors into colors or something. (5 sensations: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami). What are the artificial flavors that we smell that are supposed to natural? How come most perfumed strawberries don’t actually smell like real strawberries? They smell like a large mixture of sweet and heavy something but it’s labeled as strawberries so we associate strawberries with that artificial smell. Are these artificial smells then considered something different that we just labeled as strawberries?
  - To think about how people taste and smell things in their daily life. The ultimate purpose would be a fun and entertaining way to educate people on something that they do everyday but not necessarily think about and why there are certain labels for certain smells/tastes but it doesn’t taste like the natural thing.
2. **Emergency sounds and why they’re different from music (alert sounds v.s. calming sounds)**
  - Maybe the native sounds of Athens that we don’t hear anywhere else? Where did the police siren (and sounds that we can recognize immediately) come from? Why does everyone know the ambulance or fire truck, alarm clock, fire alarm sounds? Where is the significant difference between the sounds of music that calms us and keeps us cool versus emergency sounds?
  - Ultimate purpose would be to think about sound production, and what goes into making a sound that everybody can hear? How do emergency alarms sound like in other regions? Are they usually the same?
3. **What if we had the vision/sight of a bird? Of a worm? Of an ant? Of a fish? Of a coral reef? **
  - What are some things that you cannot see on the ground (when you’re standing on the ground) but you can when in an airplane/aerial/bird’s eye view? Birds often become blind because of the solar panels that people use and it changes their migration patterns. We all know that a bird’s eye view is way different from what we’re used to seeing. I want to construct a VR (virtual reality), or Augmented Reality (AR) where a person can view what a bird sees, or what a worm, fish sees. This would be totally interesting to see the perspective of a different animal/species. Or even something not really breathing but also living (like coral reefs).
  - Ultimate purpose would be to think about how different kinds of animals see different things in the world and what they are concerned about. Audience could be children and adults.
4. **Fermented food and culture.**
  - How are fermented foods and culture related? We eat a lot of fermented foods but we usually see the end product, not the beginning product. What does bacteria do in fermented foods? Is fermentation of foods a cultural thing? Why does cheese taste so good to Americans but fermented kimchi, for example, smell awful to a lot of Americans and they would never eat it? Who came up with the idea of fermentation? Is fermentation a cultural thing or is it tied to experimenting with foods? Who thought of pickling cucumbers?
  - Ultimate goal would be educate people in a fun and entertaining way of the all the fermented foods that they eat that perhaps are the same process and other fermented foods they wouldn’t necessarily eat or would vomit if they smelled it.
5. **Feelings of nostalgia**
  - How is the feeling of nostalgia used in advertising and things that are inclined to make people feel a certain way or buy something? We see it all the time in advertisements and TVs and we might not even understand why we long for a time of the past, why retro things are such a hit and why people love all things vintage. Many old people speak of the past very fondly, and it’s worth exploring why past events leave such a positive impression on people. 
  - Ultimate purpose would be to think about how frequently we long for a past and why that impacts some people more than others. We live most of our life in our younger years (because the days tend to be longer, you tend to experience more as you age) so as you get older, those days tend to be shorter because you don’t experience as many new experiences anymore. (Like first time you saw a movie, or the first time you went to an amusement park).
6. **Different kinds of humor based on cultural norms. **
  - What are the different kinds of humor that are common in each different region around the world? Slapstick humor, serious humor, dry humor, sarcastic/dark humor, etc. How is that seen in TV shows, movies, and advertisements? Humor is something that is invisible, and usually there are different kinds of humor in different parts of the world. How does culture influence what tickles our funny bones?
  - For people to think about the different ways that they laugh and what makes them laugh. 
7. **Fear/gut instinct.**
  - Flight/fight instinct, a lot of people say our gut instinct is there to protect us, and if you feel a certain fear in an area or upon meeting a certain person (like they’re giving off a strange vibe), to protect/shield yourself. Where does this gut instinct come from? How come some people have it while others are oblivious? It would be interesting to interview people who have it and others that don’t and see where it comes from. 
  - Ultimate goal would be to understand what it is that makes us fight or flight in dangerous circumstances. To answer the question of is there something (i.e. past experiences, spirituality, etc.) that allows certain people to sense danger and protect themselves versus someone who doesn’t? 
8. **An individual person’s gravity (scientifically and socially).**
  - Socially, how many people  actually make an impact in the world? How much of their “gravity” actually stays after they die? (The weight of their prescence/work) Scientifically, gravity is invisible but we know it exists because we see its effect. Everyone has their individual gravity, but we can’t see it. It would be interesting to see how we can measure gravity on earth.
  - To understand a little bit of the science of us as humans and people living on earth, and understand what affects us individually on a daily basis but not necessarily something that is thought of daily.
9. **How does color influence people in choosing their wardrobe in the morning?**
  - Color definitely influences people. There’s a reason that fast-food chains are red and most corporations are blue. But what about picking out your clothes in the morning? Does picking out a yellow shirt versus a green shirt determine how you are feeling that particular day?
  - To understand how much color influences us in our daily lives and just how much of an impact it has.
10. **Measuring thought.**
  - Is one thought heavier than another thought? Are “heavy” thoughts “serious” thoughts, whereas “light” thoughts “not-serious” thoughts? How are thoughts related to our conscious, subconscious, and unconscious? One way of measuring thought could be to see what people option people would choose given a choice? (Like a test, asking them to choose between one thing or another) and seeing if they “weigh” anything.
  - People are always interested in their deepest, darkest thoughts and surface level thoughts as well. It would also be cool to see/if there was a way to understand how people perceive things in certain ways but they might not even understand it themselves (subconscious).
11. **Radio waves. How much radio waves do we use in Athens, GA?**
  - We have 16 million years of radio waves and we can’t see them but we use it every single day. (Microwaves, radio, etc.). Is it actually bad for you like some people claim or is it just a myth?
  - To see the value of it. We use it everyday, it’s an integral part of our daily lives. What if it didn’t exist, how would we function?
12. **Life in other places in the universe. Fermi Paradox.**
  - How many people believe in aliens? Of course we can’t see other things, because only 5% of the universe is observable matter (the rest is dark matter and dark energy). Want to research more of this. 
  - This would be geared more towards kids and adults interested in science.
13. **Trash on roads/roadkill in Athens, GA.**
  - There are a lot of communities that pick up trash (including like college clubs), but who ultimately picks up all the trash on the side of the road? Trash is so visible in the U.S. In Athens, usually there is a pick-up day with residential trash, but who picks up the trash on the highway? What about roadkill that’s in the middle of the road? Where does it go, do people usually clean it up or is it one of those things that just disappears as many people run over it?
  - Takeaway would be to understand where all the trash goes in Athens and who does most of the cleaning of our public spaces.
14. **Currency/bartering systems.**
  - How did we decide to exchange paper for goods? Where did the dollar sign come from? Paper money/coins is physical, but the exchange for them can be time, service or goods. What are some countries/places that don’t have a currency? For example, a bartering system that used to be used. Exchanging one kind of good or something else. Where did it all start? What would happen if we still used a barter system instead of money/currency?
  - To understand where money/currency came from and what the worth of a dollar is. To also educate people by having them think about different types of money systems we don’t use in the west. 
15. **Trails and cool, hidden nature places in Athens that aren’t popular, historic or on the map (not parks/guided trails).**
  - Trails that are hidden should be more visible because it could help people explore more of Athens that is not touristy or popular. It also has a discovery element which could be fun. 
  - It’s important because there could be landmarks and places in Athens that haven’t been discovered yet and are worth discovering.
16. **Passage of time of marine animals that have populated Athens rivers, lakes, and streams since the university was established (1785), or maybe earlier.**
  - We know animals that populate the area now and today, but you don’t really hear about animals that were here before and if that population has changed or not.
  - To understand natural history of animal population and how habitats have changed into present day.
17. **Who pollinates our flowers/veggies/plants who aren’t bees?**
  - Farmers depend on bees to pollinate their flowers/plants/trees/veggies and a while back bees were in danger and many bee population were dying. What are some of the alternative pollination techniques that we have that are not bees? Because we are dependent on bees to pollinate, what can we do to prevent plants dying out if something were to happen to the bee population in the future?
  - To educate people on where their food comes from (beginning process)
18. **Landscape architects and their planning.**
  - Who plants all of the flowers and shrubs/bushes that we see as we’re going down the road? Who determined where to place the sidewalks where and etc. A lot of cities have planners that plan things on purpose – for example, a park next to a school because they think about a student’s day and it make sense to build a park next to a school zone. What is the process of planning areas like this?
  - To understand why things are placed strategically in a city/town/area. Why do some city plans seem more arbitrary than others though?
19. **The internet.**
  - The internet is this huge network that everybody pretty much uses every single day. But it’s not really visible, per say. We see the things that it can do (go on a web page, etc.) we see the user interface but we don’t really see the digits, numbers and computing stuff that goes on behind the scenes. How does it really work? 
  - To inform people how it works and maybe have some part of the design be where people can play with internet connections and see what other things they can do on it. It could also explain the patterns of what people search for or what they primarily use the internet for (buy stuff, etc.)
20. **Body temperature.**
  - Why does everyone have a different body temperature? Does having a higher body temperature automatically mean you have a faster metabolism?This interest sparked because most of the time women have a lower body temperature than men do. It used to be that in huge, corporate office buildings the temperature would be set to accommodate the male body temperature and not women, therefore – women would more often than men be uncomfortable resulting in lower work productivity in the corporate environment. It wasn’t until recently this was discovered and there have been changes for it. I want to research something in this field – especially related to the speed of metabolism and comfort levels.
  - To educate women and men alike and people with different body temperatures. Not something people usually think of but when it is noticeable it can make quite a difference.
21. **Comparing feelings of drug use and love.**
  - We’ve all heard that falling in love is often times like a drug. How come it comes easier for some other people than others? Can you measure that change when someone is falling in love? What are the patterns like of someone on drugs?
  - It would be informative, entertaining and interesting.
22. **Bacteria in high-traffic places.**
  - How much bacteria is in heavy traffic places? Where do most of this bacteria come from? I’ve heard people say toilet and doorknobs but is it safe to sit on a park bench a lot of the times? What about bus seats? Debunking rumors about bacteria. Bacteria is something we eat and also something that is very present in our daily lives. There’s a negative association with all bacteria but it’s not all bad
  - Educate people in a fun way about the living organisms we cannot see.
23. **Weighing air quality.**
  - How do you measure good air quality versus bad air quality? Does it go by weight? What are some of the substances in air? If the substances in air were colored, what would that look like? Does wind count as air? It’s everywhere, but I guess most of the time when we think of air, we like for it be invisible. If air was visible, it would probably be in the form of pollution or smog or something. What if air quality was colored based on the pollution level?
  - Audience would be people who care about air quality, or people who see a change in air quality in the summer versus winter. To understand what the air is made up of and how air quality affects us.
24. **Road signs.**
  - Who made the stop signs and road signs? When did streets determine that they needed a road sign? Who can you ask to install a road sign due to safety procedures? Also, the speed limit signs – what determines a road to have it? Stop signs and road signs are there to guide people to follow traffic safety. Has there ever been a case or incident where there was a much needed sign to prevent accidents? Who designed road signs?
  - Inform people on the safety of the roads and where/what conditions traffic accidents happen the most in.
25. **Tracing footsteps.**
  - If we counted our footsteps on any given day of the week and counted them, how many would we take and where would we go? Counting footsteps and realizing patterns, for example, that if they go to certain places just out of habit or if they are more adventurous and would go explore new places. 
  - What are some areas in Athens that people never venture out to? What are areas that average college students would never venture out to? Do they just stay within the vicinity of the campus most of the time? Interesting to have people see and think about where they go most often and if they are adventurous or habitual.
26. **Relationship between tides and climate.**
  - Measure if low tide & high tide have something to do with climate on earth. Weather is extremely unpredictable, and tides might have something to do with it.
  - Scientific, fun way of educating people in relationships in nature they might not think about or know about.
27. **Traffic of coffee shops/cafes in Athens per day, week, month. Maybe a system to have people meet each other**
  - It would be interesting to see the highest traffic areas in Athens coffee shops/cafes. Maybe just stick to the local ones (JJ’s, etc.) Why do people go to coffee shops most of the time? In a college town I would assume it is to study but maybe I could survey people and see the reason why they go (do work, actually buy coffee, hang out)
  - Exploring this topic would be interesting because it would be fun for coffee-goers (people who like to drink coffee and hang out in cafes) to see what other coffee-goers go there to do.
28. **Athen’s Sister cities. (Athens, Greece – Cortona, Italy – and Iasi, Romania)**
  - What makes a city a sister city to another city? Is there a map of all the sister cities in the U.S.? Maybe there is one for Georgia. It would be interesting to make these cities visible and connect to its own sister city.
  - Takeaway would be to understand the cities that have this relationship to Athens. Maybe what’s interesting there and what is worth exploring, also the historical element of sister cities.
29. **Magnetic attractions/fields used in Athens’ transit systems, dining hall and gyms**
  - We use magnetic strips for everything – buses/cards, to get into dining halls and gyms, so how much of these magnetic strips/fields do we use, is there a measurable unit for it?
  - Magnets are invisible but it would be interesting to educate people on something they use everyday but not necessarily think about.
30. **Voices and their pitches.**
  - Voices and their pitches is something we cannot see but other than visual things, it’s the one thing that influences us a lot. Those that listen to podcasts, the news, music knows that a person’s voice can impact the way we feel about a certain subject or how we don’t like. Maybe it reminds them of their mom, dad or grandfather, maybe raspy voices are soothing to some people. Visualizing this would be really interesting, especially comparing a political leader’s voice versus someone who is an entertainer/singer.
  - How voices influence/impact the way we think about a person or subject, maybe more than we think.
31. **Popular graphics and their origins.**
  - The “Coexist” bumper sticker sign is a graphic that was originally made a Polish guy named Piotr Mlodozeniec and never reached popularity in Poland in the early 2000s when it was made. All of a sudden it got popular, especially overseas. There’s a lot of controversy around the graphic itself, many people see the graphic as a “feel good, liberal, hippy” way of thinking that people should coexist together. Others believe that it’s anti-Christ symbol since it puts the cross and the wicca symbol together. Now in Poland it’s actually reached new popularity because of unification efforts. Although the sign itself is visible, its origin are not really well-known yet it’s very popular on the bumpers of people’s cars.
  - It would be interesting to research the origins of popular signs like this and what the public thinks of it.
32. **Phobias, and developing them.**
  - What are some ways that people develop phobias? Common phobias like spiders, snakes, loneliness, height, etc. are considered “normal” because a lot of the population has them. Some of it might even be more biological because humans have adapted to running away from poisonous snakes, so that might be why we’re scared of snakes (we’re inclined to avoid them, biologically). What about phobias that are uncommon or weird? Some phobias develop because of conditioning (like family conditioning, cultural conditioning), and being scared of something doesn’t necessarily coincide with the thing being dangerous. So what exactly needs to be conditioned from when you’re young, to make someone, say, scared of a button? Is that even possible?
  - Main takeaway should have the viewer think about what they are scared of and maybe open the conversation to see that it’s all psychologically trained.
33. **Same temperature, different comfort levels.**
  - How come the same degrees (celsius) in two different cities feel so differently, in terms of comfort levels?  What are other factors that have to do with comfort levels (dryness, humidity, etc.) 70 degrees in California, for example, feels amazing and 70 in Georgia feels kind of hot.
  - Main takeaway should explain the other factors of why degrees doesn’t necessarily matter when looking at the temperature of an area/place, but other factors like wind speed and humidity also have a lot to do with a person’s individual comfort level.
34. **Cultural shifts in the city of Athens, GA.**
  - What was huge news at one point that everybody knew about that later generations/people might not have known about? It seems like a lot of Athens is really historical, what were some wars that maybe broke out that influenced people to move? Large, government events or a migration of different kinds of people?
  - Main takeaway should be to educate locals on what was once part of their city and how it’s changed in the past 50, 100 years. The history of how the University of Georgia came to be.
35. **Average amount of time someone will spend in a college town (if they were a college student themselves).**
  - A look at all the college towns in the U.S. and how many years students stay there. (Usual 4, 2 years, or maybe even more than that?) What are some of the most popular college towns?
  - Audience  would be college students and adults, maybe high school aged teens where staying in a college town might determine if they want to attend that school or not. Also it’s interesting to look at the population of grads who stay in the college town and become a local.
